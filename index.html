    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The lights flickered as the rain beat down.</p>
    <p>Abigail paced the drawing room, waiting for Hobbes to arrive.</p>
    <p>A loud knock from the door echoed in the room.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The body lay in front of the fireplace, next to the wrought iron ash shovel, which was stained with blood.</p>
    <p>Abigail shrieked, covering her mouth with a hand as she backed away. Hobbes was nowhere to be seen.</p>
    <p>What should she do?</p>
